To create a Listing, you will be asked a variety of questions about the Accommodation to be listed, including, but not limited to, the location, capacity, size, features, and availability of the Accommodation and pricing and related rules and financial terms. In order to be featured in Listings via the Site, Application and Services, all Accommodations must have valid physical addresses. Listings will be made publicly available via the Site, Application and Services. Other Members will be able to book your Accommodation via the Site, Application and Services based upon the information provided in your Listing. You understand and agree that once a Guest requests a booking of your Accommodation, you may not request the Guest to pay a higher price than in the booking request.</p><p>You acknowledge and agree that you alone are responsible for any and all Listings and Member Content you post. Accordingly, you represent and warrant that any Listing you post and the booking of, or a Guest\'s stay at, an Accommodation in a Listing you post (i) will not breach any agreements you have entered into with any third parties, such as homeowners association, condominium, lease or rental agreements, and (ii) will (a) be in compliance with all applicable laws (such as zoning laws and laws governing rentals of residential and other properties), Tax requirements, and rules and regulations that may apply to any Accommodation included in a Listing you post (including having all required permits, licenses and registrations), and (b) not conflict with the rights of third parties. Please note that SITE_NAME assumes no responsibility for a Host\'s compliance with any agreements with or duties to third parties, applicable laws, rules and regulations. SITE_NAME reserves the right, at any time and without prior notice, to remove or disable access to any Listing for any reason, including Listings that SITE_NAME, in its sole discretion, considers to be objectionable for any reason, in violation of these Terms, or otherwise harmful to the Site, Application or Services.</p><p>If you are a Host, you understand and agree that SITE_NAME does not act as an insurer or as your contracting agent. If a Guest requests a booking of your Accommodation and stays at your Accommodation, any agreement you enter into with such Guest is between you and the Guest and SITE_NAME is not a party to it. Notwithstanding the foregoing, SITE_NAME Payments serves as the limited authorized payment collection agent of the Host for the purpose of accepting, on behalf of the Host, payments from Guests of such amounts stipulated by the Host (including cleaning or other fees and/or Taxes).</p><p>When you create a Listing, you may also choose to include certain requirements which must be met by the Members who are eligible to request a booking of your Accommodation, such as requiring Members to have a profile picture or verified phone number, in order to book your Accommodation. Any Member wishing to book Accommodations included in Listings with such requirements must meet these requirements. More information on how to set such requirements is available via the "Hosting" section of the Site, Application and Services.</p><p>If you are a Host, SITE_NAME makes certain tools available to you to help you to make informed decisions about which Members you choose to confirm or preapprove for booking for your Accommodation. You acknowledge and agree that, as a Host, you are responsible for your own acts and omissions and are also responsible for the acts and omissions of any individuals who reside at or are otherwise present at the Accommodation at your request or invitation, excluding the Guest (and the individuals the Guest invites to the Accommodation, if applicable.)</p><p>SITE_NAME recommends that Hosts obtain appropriate insurance for their Accommodations. Please review any insurance policy that you may have for your Accommodation carefully, and in particular please make sure that you are familiar with and understand any exclusions to, and any deductibles that may apply for, such insurance policy, including, but not limited to, whether or not your insurance policy will cover the actions or inactions of Guests (and the individuals the Guest invites to the Accommodation, if applicable) while at your Accommodation.</p><p>SITE_NAME may offer Hosts the option of having photographers take photographs of their Accommodations. If you as a Host choose to have a photographer do this, the photographs taken will be made available to you to include in your Listing with a watermark or tag bearing the words "SITE_NAME.com Verified Photo" or similar wording ("<b>Verified Images</b>"). You agree that you alone are responsible for ensuring that your Listing is accurately represented in the Verified Images. You alone are responsible for using the Verified Images and you warrant that you will cease to use the Verified Images or any other images if such images cease to accurately represent your Listing. All images, materials and content created by these photographers, including Verified Images, constitute SITE_NAME Content, regardless of whether you include them in your Listing. You agree that SITE_NAME may use the Verified Images&nbsp;for advertising, marketing, commercial and other business purposes in any media or platform, whether in relation to your Listing or otherwise, without further notice or compensation.</p><p><b>No Endorsement</b></p><p>SITE_NAME does not endorse any Member or any Accommodation. You understand that Verified Images are intended only to indicate a photographic representation of the Accommodation at the time the photograph was taken. Verified Images are therefore not an endorsement by SITE_NAME of any Member or any Accommodation. Members are required by these Terms to provide accurate information, and although SITE_NAME may undertake additional checks and processes designed to help verify or check the identities or backgrounds of users, we do not make any representations about, confirm, or endorse any Member or the Member\'s purported identity or background.</p><p>Any references in the Site, Application or Services to a Member being "verified" or "connected" (or similar language) only indicate that the Member has completed a relevant verification process, and does not represent anything else. Any such description is not an endorsement, certification or guarantee by SITE_NAME about any Member, including of the Member\'s identity and whether the Member is trustworthy, safe or suitable. Instead, any such description is intended to be useful information for you to evaluate when you make your own decisions about the identity and suitability of others whom you contact or interact with via the Site, Application and Services. We therefore recommend that you always exercise due diligence and care when deciding whether to stay with a Host or to accept a booking request from a Guest, or to have any other interaction with any other Member. Except as provided in the SITE_NAME <a href="SITE_URL/host_guarantee">Host Guarantee Terms and Conditions</a> ("<b>SITE_NAME Host Guarantee</b>"), which is an agreement between SITE_NAME and Hosts, we are not responsible for any damage or harm resulting from your interactions with other Members.</p><p>By using the Site, Application or Services, you agree that any legal remedy or liability that you seek to obtain for actions or omissions of other Members or other third parties will be limited to a claim against the particular Members or other third parties who caused you harm. You agree not to attempt to impose liability on or seek any legal remedy from SITE_NAME with respect to such actions or omissions. Accordingly, we encourage you to communicate directly with other Members on the Site and Services regarding any bookings or Listings made by you. This limitation shall not apply to any claim by a Host against SITE_NAME regarding the remittance of payments received from a Guest by SITE_NAME on behalf of a Host, which instead shall be subject to the limitations described in the section below entitled "Limitation of Liability".</p><p><b>Bookings and Financial Terms</b></p><p><i>Key definitions</i></p><p>"<b>Accommodation Fees</b>" means the amounts that are due and payable by a Guest in exchange for that Guest\'s stay in an Accommodation. The Host alone, and not SITE_NAME, is responsible for the Accommodation Fees for his or her Listing. The Host may in his or her sole discretion decide to include in these amounts (i) a cleaning fee or any other fee permitted on the SITE_NAME platform, or (ii) Taxes that the Host determines that he or she has to collect. <br></p><p>"<b>Guest Fees</b>" means the fee that SITE_NAME charges a Guest for the use of the Services, which is calculated as a percentage of the applicable Accommodation Fees. The Guest Fees will be displayed to the Guest when the Guest is asked whether to send a booking request to a Host. <br></p><p>"<b>Host Fees</b>" means the fee that SITE_NAME charges a Host for the use of the Services, which is calculated as a percentage of the applicable Accommodation Fees. The Host Fees will be displayed to the Host when the Host is asked whether to confirm or reject a booking request from a prospective Guest. <br></p><p>"<b>Service Fees</b>" means collectively the Guest Fees and the Host Fees. <br></p><p>"<b>Total Fees</b>" means collectively the Accommodation Fees and the Guest Fees plus any Taxes.</p><p><i>Bookings and Financial Terms for Hosts and Guests</i></p><p>If you are a Host and a booking is requested for your Accommodation via the Site, Application or Services, you will be required to either confirm or reject the booking request within the Booking Request Period, otherwise the booking request will automatically expire. When a booking is requested via the Site, Application or Services, we will share with you (i) the first and last name of the Guest who has requested the booking, (ii) a link to the Guest\'s SITE_NAME Account profile page, (iii) if the Guest and Host have both connected their SITE_NAME accounts to SNS, the names of any members of an SNS with whom you are "friends" or associated on the SNS if such individuals are also "friends" or associated with the Guest on such SNS, and (iv) an indication of whether or not the Guest has provided other information to SITE_NAME, such as a verified email address, connection to SNSs, or a government ID. If you are unable to confirm or decide to reject a booking request within the Booking Request Period, any amounts collected by SITE_NAME for the requested booking will be refunded to the applicable Guest\'s credit card and any pre-authorization of such credit card will be released. When you confirm a booking requested by a Guest, SITE_NAME will send you an email, text message or message via the Application confirming such booking, depending on the selections you make via the Site, Application and Services.</p><p>SITE_NAME Payments will collect the Total Fees at the time of booking confirmation (i.e. when the Host confirms the booking request) and will initiate payment of the Accommodation Fees (less SITE_NAME\'s Host Fees and any Taxes in respect of the Host Fees, such as VAT in Europe) to the Host within 24 hours of when the Guest arrives at the applicable Accommodation (except to the extent that a refund is due to the Guest). The time it takes for the Host to receive payouts may depend upon the payout method chosen by the Host. Some methods involve the use of third-party payment processors, who may impose their own additional charges for the use of their services on the Host, including by deducting their charges from the payout amount.</p><p>If you owe or agree to pay any amount via SITE_NAME Payments to SITE_NAME (whether as a result of your bookings or actions as a Guest or otherwise), then SITE_NAME Payments may (but is not obliged to) withhold the amount owing to SITE_NAME from any payout amounts due to you as a Host, and use the withheld amount to setoff the amount owed by you to SITE_NAME. If SITE_NAME Payments does so, then your obligation to pay SITE_NAME will be extinguished to the extent of the amount withheld by SITE_NAME Payments, and SITE_NAME will cease to owe to you any obligations (including, but not limited to, any obligation to pay you) with respect to the amount withheld. In addition to the amount due, if your account is delinquent or you otherwise have chargebacks on your account, you may be charged fees that are incidental to our collection of these delinquent amounts and chargebacks. Such fees or charges may include collection fees, convenience fees, or other third party charges. You hereby explicitly agree that all communication in relation to delinquent accounts will be made by electronic mail or by phone, as provided to SITE_NAME by you. Such communication may be made by SITE_NAME or by anyone on its behalf, including but not limited to a third party collection agent.</p><p><i>Appointment of SITE_NAME Payments as Limited Payment Collection Agent for Host</i></p><p>Each Host hereby appoints SITE_NAME Payments as the Host\'s limited payment collection agent solely for the purpose of accepting the Accommodation Fees from Guests.</p><p>Each Host agrees that payment made by a Guest through SITE_NAME Payments, shall be considered the same as a payment made directly to the Host, and the Host will make the Accommodation available to the Guest in the agreed-upon manner as if the Host has received the Accommodation Fees. Each Host agrees that SITE_NAME may, in accordance with the cancellation policy selected by the Host and reflected in the relevant Listing, (i) permit the Guest to cancel the booking and (ii) refund (via SITE_NAME Payments) to the Guest that portion of the Accommodation Fees specified in the applicable cancellation policy. Each Host understands that as SITE_NAME Payments accepts payments from Guests as the Host\'s limited payment collection agent and that SITE_NAME Payments\' obligation to pay the Host is subject to and conditional upon successful receipt of the associated payments from Guests. SITE_NAME does not guarantee payments to Hosts for amounts that have not been successfully received by SITE_NAME Payments from Guests. In accepting appointment as the limited authorized agent of the Host, SITE_NAME Payments assumes no liability for any acts or omissions of the Host.</p><p>Please note that SITE_NAME does not currently charge fees for the creation of Listings. However, you as a Host acknowledge and agree that SITE_NAME reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to charge you for and collect fees from you for the creation of Listings. Please note that SITE_NAME will provide notice of any Listing fee collection via the Site, Application and Services, prior to implementing such a Listing fee feature.</p><p><i>Bookings and Financial Terms for Guests</i></p><p>The Hosts, not SITE_NAME, are solely responsible for honoring any confirmed bookings and making available any Accommodations reserved through the Site, Application and Services. If you, as a Guest, choose to enter into a transaction with a Host for the booking of an Accommodation, you agree and understand that you will be required to enter into an agreement with the Host and you agree to accept any terms, conditions, rules and restrictions associated with such Accommodation imposed by the Host. You acknowledge and agree that you, and not SITE_NAME, will be responsible for performing the obligations of any such agreements, that SITE_NAME is not a party to such agreements, and that, with the exception of its payment obligations hereunder, SITE_NAME disclaims all liability arising from or related to any such agreements. You acknowledge and agree that, notwithstanding the fact that SITE_NAME is not a party to the agreement between you and the Host, SITE_NAME Payments acts as the Host\'s payment collection agent for the limited purpose of accepting payments from you on behalf of the Host. Upon your payment of the Total Fees to SITE_NAME Payments, your payment obligation to the Host for the Accommodation Fees is extinguished, and SITE_NAME Payments is responsible for remitting the Accommodation Fees (less the Host Fees and any Taxes in respect of the Host Fees, such as VAT in Europe), in the manner described in these Terms. In the event that SITE_NAME Payments does not remit any such amounts as described in these Terms, such Host will have recourse only against such SITE_NAME entity.</p><p>The Total Fees payable will be displayed to a Guest before the Guest sends a booking request to a Host. As noted above, the Host is required to either confirm or reject the booking request within the Booking Request Period; otherwise, the requested booking will be automatically cancelled. If a requested booking is cancelled (i.e. not confirmed by the applicable Host), any amounts collected by SITE_NAME Payments will be refunded to such Guest, depending on the selections the Guest makes via the Site and Application, and any pre-authorization of such Guest\'s credit card will be released, if applicable.</p><p>You as a Guest agree to pay SITE_NAME for the Total Fees for any booking requested in connection with your SITE_NAME Account if such requested bookings are confirmed by the applicable Host. In order to establish a booking pending the applicable Host\'s confirmation of your requested booking, you understand and agree that SITE_NAME Payments, on behalf of the Host, reserve the right, in its sole discretion, to (i) obtain a pre-authorization via your credit card for the Total Fees or (ii) charge your credit card a nominal amount, not to exceed one dollar ($1), or a similar sum in the currency in which you are transacting (e.g. one euro or one British pound), to verify your credit card. As a general rule, SITE_NAME Payments will collect the Total Fees due once SITE_NAME receives confirmation of your booking from the applicable Host; if necessary, Total Fees may instead be collected at a later point. Please note that SITE_NAME cannot control any fees that may be charged to a Guest by his or her bank related to SITE_NAME\'s collection of the Total Fees, and SITE_NAME disclaims all liability in this regard.</p><p>In connection with your requested booking, you will be asked to provide customary billing information such as name, billing address and credit card information either to SITE_NAME Payments or its third-party payment processor(s). You agree to pay SITE_NAME Payments for any confirmed bookings made in connection with your SITE_NAME Account in accordance with these Terms by one of the methods described on the Site or Application, e.g. by PayPal or credit card. You hereby authorize the collection of such amounts by charging the credit card provided as part of requesting the booking, either directly by SITE_NAME Payments or indirectly, via a third-party online payment processor or by one of the payment methods described on the Site or Application. You also authorize SITE_NAME Payments to charge your credit card in the event of damage caused at an Accommodation as contemplated under "Damage to Accommodations" below and for Security Deposits, if applicable. If you are directed to SITE_NAME Payments\' third-party payment processor(s), you may be subject to terms and conditions governing use of that third party\'s service and that third party\'s personal information collection practices. Please review such terms and conditions and privacy policy before using the services. Once your confirmed booking transaction is complete you will receive a confirmation email summarizing your confirmed booking.</p><p><b>Security Deposits</b></p><p>Hosts may choose to include security deposits in their Listings ("<b>Security Deposits</b>"). Each Listing will describe whether a Security Deposit is required for the applicable Accommodation. If a Security Deposit is included in a Listing for a confirmed booking of an Accommodation, and a Host makes a claim against such Security Deposit, SITE_NAME Payments will, in its capacity as the payment collection agent of the Host, use its commercially reasonable efforts to charge the Guest\'s payment method in the amount of the Security Deposit, within a reasonable period of time after the Guest\'s check-out from the Host\'s Accommodation. SITE_NAME will also use its commercially reasonable efforts to address Hosts\' requests and claims related to Security Deposits, but SITE_NAME is not responsible for administering or accepting any claims by Hosts related to Security Deposits, and disclaims any and all liability in this regard.</p><p><b>Service Fees</b></p><p>In consideration for the use of SITE_NAME\'s online marketplace and platform, SITE_NAME charges the Service Fees. Where applicable, Taxes (such as VAT in Europe) may also be charged in respect of the Host Fees and Guest Fees.

Except as otherwise provided herein, Service Fees are non-refundable.</p><p><b>General Booking and Financial Terms</b></p><p><i>Cancellations and Refunds</i></p><p>If, as a Guest, you cancel your requested booking before the requested booking is confirmed by a Host, SITE_NAME Payments will cancel any pre-authorization to your credit card and/or refund any nominal amounts charged to your credit card in connection with the requested booking within a commercially reasonable time. If, as a Guest, you wish to cancel a confirmed booking made via the Site, Application and Services, either prior to or after arriving at the Accommodation, the cancellation policy of the Host contained in the applicable Listing will apply to such cancellation. Our ability to refund the Accommodation Fees and other amounts charged to you will depend upon the terms of the applicable cancellation policy. Details regarding refunds and cancellation policies are available via the Site and Application. The Guest Fee is non-refundable regardless of the cancellation policy selected by the Host.</p><p>If a Host cancels a confirmed booking made via the Site, Services, and Application, (i) SITE_NAME Payments will refund the Total Fees for such booking to the applicable Guest within a commercially reasonable time of the cancellation and (ii) the Guest will receive an email or other communication from SITE_NAME containing alternative Listings and other related information. If the Guest requests a booking from one of the alternative Listings and the Host associated with such alternative Listing confirms the Guest\'s requested booking, then the Guest agrees to pay SITE_NAME the Total Fees relating to the confirmed booking for the Accommodation in the alternative Listing, in accordance with these Terms. If a Host cancelled a confirmed booking and you, as a Guest, have not received an email or other communication from SITE_NAME.</p><p>If, as a Host, you cancel a confirmed booking, you agree that SITE_NAME may apply penalties or consequences to you or your Listing, including (i) publishing an automated review on your Listing indicating that a reservation was cancelled, (ii) keeping the calendar for your Listing unavailable or blocked for the dates of the cancelled booking, or (iii) imposing a cancellation fee (to be withheld from your future payouts or charged to the&nbsp;credit card on file in your SITE_NAME Account). You will be notified of the situations in which a cancellation fee applies before you decide to cancel.</p><p>In certain circumstances, SITE_NAME may decide, in its sole discretion, that it is necessary or desirable to cancel a confirmed booking made via the Site, Application and Services. This may be for reasons set forth or for any other reason. SITE_NAME Payments may also determine, in its sole discretion, to refund to the Guest part or all of the amounts charged to the Guest in accordance with the <a href="SITE_URL/guest_refund">Guest Refund Policy</a>. You agree that SITE_NAME and the relevant Guest or Host will not have any liability for such cancellations or refunds.</p><p>If, as a Host, your Guest cancels a confirmed booking or SITE_NAME decides that it is necessary to cancel a confirmed booking, and SITE_NAME issues a refund to the Guest in accordance with the Guest Refund Policy or other applicable cancellation policies, you agree that in the event you have already been paid SITE_NAME shall be entitled to recover the amount of any such Guest refund from you, including by subtracting such refund amount out from any future Accommodation Fees due to you.</p><p><i>Recurring Payments</i></p><p>In some instances, Guests may be required to make recurring, incremental payments toward the Total Fees owed for a confirmed booking before beginning his or her stay at the applicable Accommodation (collectively, "<b>Recurring Payments</b>"). More information on Recurring Payments will be made available via the Site, Application and Services, if applicable. If Recurring Payments apply to a confirmed booking, then the Guest authorizes SITE_NAME Payments, on behalf of the Host, to collect the Total Fees and the Host agrees that such SITE_NAME entity will initiate payouts to the Host, in the increments and at the frequency associated with the applicable Recurring Payments, each as identified on the Site, Application and Services.</p><p><i>Rounding Off</i></p><p>SITE_NAME may, in its sole discretion, round up or round down amounts that are payable from or to Guests or Hosts to the nearest whole functional base unit in which the currency is denominated (e.g. to the nearest dollar, euro or other supported currency); for example, SITE_NAME will round up an amount of $101.50 to $102.00, and $101.49 to $101.00.</p><p>Some currencies are denominated in large numbers. In those cases, SITE_NAME may determine the functional base unit in which those currencies are denominated to be 10, 100 or 1,000 of the currency; the corresponding examples for such currencies would be for SITE_NAME to round up an amount of 1,045 up to 1,050 and 1,044 down to 1,040, or 35,450 up to 35,500 and 35,449 down to 35,400, or 837,500 up to 838,000 and 837,499 down to 837,000.</p><p><i>Payment Processing Errors</i></p><p>We will take steps to rectify any payment processing errors that we become aware of. These steps may include crediting or debiting (as appropriate) the same payment method used for the original payout to or payment by you, so that you end up receiving or paying the correct amount.&nbsp;</p><p><i>Donations</i></p><p>Some Hosts may pledge to donate a portion of the funds they receive from confirmed bookings made via the Site, Application and Services to a particular cause or charity. We do not take any responsibility or liability for whether the Host does in fact make the donation he or she pledged to make. In such cases, the Host in question is responsible for his or her own compliance with all laws and regulations applicable to such pledges and/or fund-raising.</p><p><b>Taxes</b></p><p>Tax regulations may require us to collect appropriate tax information from our Hosts, or to withhold taxes from payouts to Hosts, or both. For instance, IRS regulations stipulate that we must collect an IRS Form W-9 from our US Hosts, and an appropriate IRS Form W-8 (e.g. Form W-8BEN) from non-US hosts with at least one Listing in the US. You as a Host are solely responsible for keeping the information in your tax forms current, complete and accurate. If you as a Host fail to provide us with documentation that we determine to be sufficient to alleviate our obligation (if any) to withhold taxes from payments to you (e.g. where you are a US Host and you fail to provide us with a completed IRS Form W-9), we reserve the right in our sole discretion to freeze all payouts to you until resolution, to withhold such amounts as required by law, or to do both.</p><p>You as a Host understand and agree that you are solely responsible for determining (i) your applicable Tax reporting requirements, and (ii) the Taxes that should be included, and for including Taxes to be collected or obligations relating to applicable Taxes in Listings. You are also solely responsible for remitting to the relevant authority any Taxes included or received by you. SITE_NAME cannot and does not offer Tax-related advice to any Members.</p><p>Where applicable, or based upon request from a Host, SITE_NAME may issue a valid VAT invoice to such Host.</p><p>You understand and acknowledge that appropriate governmental agencies, departments or authorities (the "<b>Tax Authority</b>") where your Accommodation is located may require Taxes to be collected from Guests or Hosts on the amount paid for the right to use and/or occupancy of accommodations, and to be remitted to the respective Tax Authority. The laws in jurisdictions may vary, but these taxes may be required to be collected and remitted as a percentage of the rent or Accommodation Fees set by Hosts, a set amount per day, or other variations, and are sometimes called "occupancy taxes," "hotel taxes," "lodging taxes," "transient taxes," "sales and use taxes," "value added taxes," "room taxes" or "tourist taxes" (hereafter, "<b>Occupancy Taxes</b>").</p><p><i>Occupancy Tax Collection and Remittance</i></p><p>In certain jurisdictions, SITE_NAME may decide in its sole discretion to facilitate collection and remittance of Occupancy Taxes from or on behalf of Guests or Hosts, in accordance with your directions in this Agreement ("Collection and Remittance") if such tax jurisdiction asserts SITE_NAME or Hosts have a tax collection and remittance obligation. In any jurisdiction in which we decide to facilitate direct Collection and Remittance, whether you are a Guest or Host, in lieu of the Host collecting Occupancy taxes from Guests and remitting to the Tax Authority, you hereby instruct and authorize SITE_NAME to collect Occupancy Taxes from Guests on the Host\'s behalf at the time Accommodation Fees are collected, and to remit such Occupancy Taxes to the Tax Authority. When SITE_NAME facilitates Collection and Remittance of Occupancy Taxes in a jurisdiction for the first time, SITE_NAME will provide notice to existing Hosts with Listings for Accommodations in such jurisdictions. When a new listing is created in a jurisdiction where SITE_NAME facilitates Collection and Remittance of Occupancy Taxes, the Host will be notified in the listing creation flow. &nbsp;</p><p>The amount of Occupancy Taxes, if any, collected and remitted by SITE_NAME will be visible to and separately stated to both Guests and Hosts on their respective transaction documents. Where SITE_NAME is directly facilitating Collection and Remittance, Guests and Hosts agree that Hosts are not permitted to attempt collection, or collect any Occupancy Taxes relating to their Accommodations on SITE_NAME in that such jurisdiction. You expressly agree to release, defend, indemnify, and hold SITE_NAME and its affiliates and subsidiaries, and their officers, directors, employees and agents, harmless from and against any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, debts, obligations, and expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable legal and/or accounting fees, arising out of or in any way related to Occupancy Taxes, including, without limitation, the applicability of, calculation, collection or remittance of Occupancy Taxes in any amount or at all as to your transactions or Accommodations. &nbsp;&nbsp;For any jurisdiction in which we facilitate Collection and Remittance, Hosts and Guests expressly grant us permission, without further notice, to store, transfer and disclose data and other information relating to them or to their Transactions, Bookings, Accommodations and Occupancy Taxes, including, but not limited to, personally identifiable information such as Host or Guest\'s name, listing addresses, transaction dates and amounts, tax identification number(s), the amount of taxes collected from Guests or allegedly due, contact information and similar information, to the relevant Tax Authority.</p><p><i>Opt-in to Host Remittance of Taxes</i></p><p>In other jurisdictions, SITE_NAME may decide in its sole discretion to facilitate Occupancy Tax collection on behalf of Hosts and Guests in accordance with a Host\'s direction to opt in to a specific Occupancy Tax line item in the booking process, in which the Host directs that Occupancy Taxes from Guests be sent directly to the Host so that the Host will remit such taxes directly to Tax Authority -(-"Opt-in for Host Remittance"). In any jurisdiction in which we decide to facilitate Collection by Opt-in for Host Remittance, whether you are a Guest or Host, you hereby instruct and authorize SITE_NAME to send Occupancy Taxes received from Guests at the time Accommodation Fees are collected to the Host who is obligated to send such taxes to the Tax Authority directly. If SITE_NAME offers and a Host selects Opt-in for Host Remittance in any jurisdiction, Hosts and Guests remain solely responsible and liable for the payment and remittance of any and all taxes that may apply to Accommodations; you agree and understand that SITE_NAME is not responsible for, and will not send any such Occupancy Taxes to the Tax Authority under Opt-in to Host Remittance of Taxes. &nbsp;You hereby agree that through third party payment processors, SITE_NAME is merely processing Your election and direction to have Occupancy Taxes from Guests sent directly to the Host for remittance by the Host to the Tax Authority, and that You will remit all amounts collected from Guests as Occupancy Taxes to such Tax Authority. &nbsp;You expressly agree to release, defend, indemnify, and hold SITE_NAME and its affiliates and subsidiaries, and their officers, directors, employees and agents, harmless from and against any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, debts, obligations, and expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable legal and/or accounting fees, arising out of or in any way related to Occupancy Taxes, &nbsp;including, without limitation, the applicability of, calculation of, collection of Occupancy Taxes in any amount or at all as to your transactions or Accommodations. &nbsp;For any jurisdiction in which we facilitate Opt-in for Host Remittance, Hosts and Guests expressly grant us permission, without further notice, to store, transfer and disclose data and other information relating to them or to their Transactions, Bookings, Accommodations and Occupancy Taxes, including, but not limited to, personally identifiable information such as Host or Guest\'s name, listing addresses, transaction dates and amounts, tax identification number(s), the amount of taxes received by Hosts from Guests, or allegedly due, contact information and similar information, to the relevant Tax Authority.</p><p><i>Miscellaneous Occupancy Tax Provisions</i></p><p>Whether you are a Guest or Host, you agree that any claim or cause of action relating to SITE_NAME\'s facilitation of Opt-in Remittance or Collection and Remittance of Taxes shall not extend to any supplier or vendor that may be used by SITE_NAME in connection with facilitation of Opt-in Remittance or Collection and Remittance&nbsp;of Occupancy Taxes, if any. Guests and Hosts agree that we may seek additional amounts from You in the event that the Taxes collected and/or remitted are insufficient to fully discharge your obligations to the Tax Authority, and agree that your sole remedy for Occupancy Taxes collected is a refund of Occupancy Taxes collected by SITE_NAME from the applicable Tax Authority in accordance with applicable procedures set by that Tax Authority.</p><p>In any jurisdiction in which we have not provided notice of, or are not facilitating (or are no longer facilitating) the collection or remittance of Occupancy Taxes by Collection and Remittance, Opt-in for Host Remittance or any other means or method, in your jurisdiction, Hosts and Guests remain solely responsible and liable for the collection and/or remittance of any and all Occupancy Taxes that may apply to Accommodations.</p><p>Hosts and Guests acknowledge and agree that in some jurisdictions, SITE_NAME may decide not to facilitate collection or remittance of Occupancy Taxes or may not be able to facilitate the collection and/or remittance of Occupancy Taxes, and nothing contained in this Agreement is a representation or guarantee that SITE_NAME will facilitate collection and/or remittance of Occupancy Tax anywhere at all, including in any specific jurisdiction, or that SITE_NAME will continue to facilitate any collection or remittance of Occupancy Tax in any specific jurisdiction in which it may have been offered. SITE_NAME reserves the right, in its sole determination, to cease any facilitation of any collection and remittance of Occupancy Tax (regardless of method used or to be used in the future) for any reason or no reason at all, provided that it will give Hosts reasonable notice in any jurisdiction in which SITE_NAME determines to cease any such facilitation. &nbsp;</p><p><i>Damage to Accommodations</i></p><p>As a Guest, you are responsible for leaving the Accommodation in the condition it was in when you arrived. You acknowledge and agree that, as a Guest, you are responsible for your own acts and omissions and are also responsible for the acts and omissions of any individuals whom you invite to, or otherwise provide access to, the Accommodation. In the event that a Host claims otherwise and provides evidence of damage, including but not limited to photographs, you agree to pay the cost of replacing the damaged items with equivalent items. After being notified of the claim and given forty eight (48) hours to respond, the payment will be charged to and taken from the credit card on file in your SITE_NAME Account. SITE_NAME also reserves the right to charge the credit card on file in your SITE_NAME Account, or otherwise collect payment from you and pursue any avenues available to SITE_NAME in this regard, including using Security Deposits, in situations in which you have been determined, in SITE_NAME\'s sole discretion, to have damaged any Accommodation, including, but not limited to, in relation to any payment requests made by Hosts under the SITE_NAME Host Guarantee, and in relation to any payments made by SITE_NAME to Hosts. If we are unable to charge the credit card on file or otherwise collect payment from you, you agree to remit payment for any damage to the Accommodation to the applicable Host or to SITE_NAME (if applicable).</p><p>Both Guests and Hosts agree to cooperate with and assist SITE_NAME in good faith, and to provide SITE_NAME with such information and take such actions as may be reasonably requested by SITE_NAME, in connection with any complaints or claims made by Members relating to Accommodations or any personal or other property located at an Accommodation (including, without limitation, payment requests made under the SITE_NAME Host Guarantee) or with respect to any investigation undertaken by SITE_NAME or a representative of SITE_NAME regarding use or abuse of the Site, Application or the Services. If you are a Guest, upon SITE_NAME\'s reasonable request, and to the extent you are reasonably able to do so, you agree to participate in mediation or similar resolution process with a Host, at no cost to you, which process will be conducted by SITE_NAME or a third party selected by SITE_NAME or its insurer, with respect to losses for which the Host is requesting payment from SITE_NAME under the SITE_NAME Host Guarantee.</p><p>If you are a Guest, you understand and agree that SITE_NAME may make a claim under your homeowner\'s, renter\'s or other insurance policy related to any damage or loss that you may have caused or been responsible for or to an Accommodation or any personal or other property located at an Accommodation (including without limitation amounts paid by SITE_NAME under the SITE_NAME Host Guarantee). You agree to cooperate with and assist SITE_NAME in good faith, and to provide SITE_NAME with such information as may be reasonably requested by SITE_NAME, in order to make a claim under your homeowner\'s, renter\'s or other insurance policy, including, but not limited to, executing documents and taking such further acts as SITE_NAME may reasonably request to assist SITE_NAME in accomplishing the foregoing.</p><p><i>Overstaying without the Host\'s Consent</i></p><p>Guests agree that a confirmed reservation is merely a license granted by the Host to the Guest to enter and use the Listing for the limited duration of the confirmed reservation and in accordance with the Guest\'s agreement with the Host. Guests further agree to leave the Accommodation no later than the checkout time that the Host specifies in the Listing or such other time as mutually agreed upon between the Host and Guest. If a Guest stays past the agreed upon checkout time without the Host\'s consent, they no longer have a license to stay in the Listing and the Host is entitled to make the Guest leave. In addition, Guests agree that the Host can charge the Guest, for each 24 hour period that the Guest stays over the agreed period without the Host\'s consent, an additional nightly fee of two times the average nightly Accommodation Fee originally paid by the Guest to cover the inconvenience suffered by the Host, plus all applicable Service Fees, Taxes, and any legal expenses incurred by the Host to make the Guest leave (collectively, "Additional Sums"). Guests agree that SITE_NAME Payments, in its role as limited collection agent for the Host, shall charge the Guest\'s credit card or other payment methods it has on file to collect these Additional Sums. In addition, SITE_NAME Payments may recover any costs and expenses it incurs in collecting the Additional Sums by charging the Guest\'s credit card or other payment method on file.</p><p><b>Foreign Currency</b></p><p>SITE_NAME\'s online platform facilitates bookings between Guests and Hosts who may prefer to pay and to receive payments in different currencies, which may require foreign currency conversions to accommodate these differing currency preferences. Although the SITE_NAME platform allows users to view the price of Listings in a number of currencies, the currencies available for users to make and receive payments may be limited, and may not include the default currency in any given geographic location.</p><p>Each foreign currency conversion is processed at a foreign currency conversion rate. This rate generally refers to the amount of one currency that must be paid to buy a certain amount of another currency at a given time. For example, if it costs US$125.00 to buy €100.00, the currency conversion rate of US dollars to Euros would be 1.25, and the currency conversion rate from Euros to US dollars would be 0.8. Currency conversion rates will vary from time to time.</p><p><i>Key definitions</i></p><p>"<b>Display Currency</b>" means the currency in which users view Listing prices on the SITE_NAME platform. Guests may choose and change the Display Currency in order to view the pricing for a Listing in a number of different supported currencies. <br></p><p>"<b>Booking Currency</b>" means the currency in which a Guest has to pay for his or her booking. At the time the Guest submits a booking request, the SITE_NAME platform will select the Booking Currency, based on the Guest\'s country of origin and the payment methods available for that country. SITE_NAME supports only a certain number of currencies as Booking Currencies. The Booking Currency for a booking may be different from the relevant Listing Currency. <br></p><p>"<b>Listing Currency</b>" means the currency in which a Listing\'s price is set. The Listing Currency is set by the Host. <br></p><p>"<b>Payout Currency</b>" means the currency in which a Host\'s payout will be paid to the Host. The Payout Currency is set by the Host. <br></p><p>"<b>Base Exchange Rate</b>" means a system-wide rate used by SITE_NAME for foreign currency conversion that is in effect at the time the foreign currency conversion is processed, and does not include any fee or mark-up by SITE_NAME. SITE_NAME establishes the Base Exchange Rate using data from one or more third parties such as OANDA (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.oanda.com">http://www.oanda.com</a>). <br></p><p>"<b>Adjusted Exchange Rate</b>" means a rate for foreign currency conversion that is calculated by adding a mark-up to the Base Exchange Rate. This mark-up represents a charge imposed by SITE_NAME for its holding costs and foreign currency risks.</p><p><i>Foreign currency conversions on the SITE_NAME platform</i></p><p>SITE_NAME Payments will process a foreign currency conversion in the following situations:</p><p></p><ul><li>The Display Currency is different from the Listing Currency when a user views a Listing: SITE_NAME will calculate the estimated Total Fees in the Display Currency, by applying either the Base Exchange Rate or the Adjusted Exchange Rate at the time of the view to the estimated Total Fees in the Listing Currency. The Adjusted Exchange Rate will be applied if the Display Currency is a supported Booking Currency, and it is different from the Listing Currency. Otherwise, the Base Exchange Rate will be applied.</li><li>The Booking Currency is different from the Listing Currency when a Guest submits a booking request for a Listing: SITE_NAME will calculate the Total Fees in the Booking Currency, by applying either the Base Exchange Rate or the Adjusted Exchange Rate at the time of the booking request to the Total Fees in the Listing Currency. The Guest will be able to view the actual exchange rate applied. The Guest Fee, which is a percentage of the applicable Accommodation Fees, will be calculated based on the Accommodation Fees in the Booking Currency (i.e. after conversion from the Listing Currency). The Adjusted Exchange Rate will be applied if the Display Currency is the same as the Booking Currency, and it is different from the Listing Currency for the Listing. Otherwise, the Base Exchange Rate will be applied.</li><li>The Payout Currency is different from the Listing Currency when SITE_NAME initiates a payout: generally, SITE_NAME will calculate the payout to the Host, by applying the Base Exchange Rate on the date that SITE_NAME initiates the payout to the Accommodation Fees (less SITE_NAME\'s Host Fees and any Taxes in respect of the Host Fees, such as VAT in Europe) in the Listing Currency. The Host will be able to view the actual exchange rate applied in his or her transaction history in the Site or Application. In some cases where the payout method selected by the Host involves certain third-party payment processors (such as Western Union), (i) SITE_NAME will send the payout amount to the processor in a major currency (e.g. US dollars), by applying the relevant Base Exchange Rate for the Listing Currency to that major currency, (ii) the Host will be able to view the payout amount sent by SITE_NAME in that major currency in his or her transaction history in the Site or Application, and (iii) the processor will calculate the actual payout to the Host by applying its own foreign currency conversion rate for that major currency to the Payout Currency.</li><li>When a confirmed booking is modified or cancelled, and there had been a foreign currency conversion when the booking was submitted: the foreign currency conversion for any additional payments required of the Guest or any refund to the Guest will be processed at the same rate as applied to the earlier payment by the Guest.</li></ul><p></p><p>When you as a Guest submit a booking request for a Listing, you will be able to view the actual exchange rate used to calculate the Total Fees in the Booking Currency. Where the Adjusted Exchange Rate is applied, you will be able to view the mark-up included in the rate. The actual exchange rate (and any mark-up included in the rate) will also be stated in the billing receipt for your booking.</p><p>SITE_NAME updates the Base Exchange Rate on a regular basis, but not on a real-time basis. In particular, SITE_NAME does not always change the Base Exchange Rate immediately when its costs of foreign exchange change. Accordingly, the Base Exchange Rate may not be identical to the applicable market rate in effect at the specific time a foreign currency conversion is processed.</p><p>Please note that your payment company (for example, your credit or bank card issuer) will use a currency conversion rate for and may impose a currency conversion fee on your payment or payout, if your card or bank account is denominated in a currency that is different from the Booking Currency or the Payout Currency respectively. Similarly, third-party payment processors may also use a currency conversion rate for or impose a currency conversion fee on your payment or payout. All of these currency conversion rates and fees are not controlled by or known to SITE_NAME.</p><p><b>User Conduct</b></p><p>You understand and agree that you are solely responsible for compliance with any and all laws, rules, regulations, and Tax obligations that may apply to your use of the Site, Application, Services and Collective Content.

You acknowledge and agree that you and SITE_NAME are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class action or representative proceeding. Further, unless both you and SITE_NAME otherwise agree in writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person\'s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class or representative proceeding. If this specific paragraph is held unenforceable, then the entirety of this "Dispute Resolution" section will be deemed void. Except as provided in the preceding sentence, this "Dispute Resolution" section will survive any termination of these Terms.</p><p><u>Arbitration Rules and Governing Law</u>. The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association ("<b>AAA</b>") in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (the "<b>AAA Rules</b>") then in effect, except as modified by this "Dispute Resolution" section. (The AAA Rules are available at&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.adr.org/arb_med">www.adr.org/arb_med</a> or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.) The Federal Arbitration Act will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this section.</p><p><u>Arbitration Process</u>. A party who desires to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a written Demand for Arbitration as specified in the AAA Rules. (The AAA provides a <a href="http://www.adr.org/aaa/ShowPDF?doc=ADRSTG_004175">form Demand for Arbitration</a>&nbsp;and a separate <a href="http://adr.org/aaa/ShowPDF?doc=ADRSTG_004314">form for California residents</a>) The arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law in the state of California and will be selected by the parties from the AAA\'s roster of consumer dispute arbitrators. If the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within seven (7) days of delivery of the Demand for Arbitration, then the AAA will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with the AAA Rules.</p><p><u>Arbitration Location and Procedure</u>. Unless you and SITE_NAME otherwise agree, the arbitration will be conducted in the county where you reside. If your claim does not exceed $10,000, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents you and SITE_NAME submit to the arbitrator, unless you request a hearing or the arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary. If your claim exceeds $10,000, your right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Subject to the AAA Rules, the arbitrator will have the discretion to direct a reasonable exchange of information by the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration.</p><p><u>Arbitrator\'s Decision</u>. The arbitrator will render an award within the time frame specified in the AAA Rules. The arbitrator\'s decision will include the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator based the award. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The arbitrator\'s award damages must be consistent with the terms of the "Limitation of Liability" section above as to the types and the amounts of damages for which a party may be held liable. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the claimant and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the claimant\'s individual claim. If you prevail in arbitration you will be entitled to an award of attorneys\' fees and expenses, to the extent provided under applicable law. SITE_NAME will not seek, and hereby waives all rights it may have under applicable law to recover, attorneys\' fees and expenses if it prevails in arbitration.</p><p><u>Fees</u>. Your responsibility to pay any AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees will be solely as set forth in the AAA Rules. However, if your claim for damages does not exceed $75,000, SITE_NAME will pay all such fees unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in your Demand for Arbitration was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)).</p><p><u>Changes</u>. Notwithstanding the provisions of the "Modification" section above, if SITE_NAME changes this "Dispute Resolution" section after the date you first accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms), you may reject any such change by sending us written notice (including by email) within 30 days of the date such change became effective, as indicated in the "Last Updated Date" above or in the date of SITE_NAME\'s email to you notifying you of such change. By rejecting any change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any Dispute between you and SITE_NAME in accordance with the provisions of this "Dispute Resolution" section as of the date you first accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms).</p><p><b>General</b></p><p>The failure of SITE_NAME to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not constitute a waiver of future enforcement of that right or provision. The waiver of any such right or provision will be effective only if in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of SITE_NAME. Except as expressly set forth in these Terms, the exercise by either party of any of its remedies under these Terms will be without prejudice to its other remedies under these Terms or otherwise. If for any reason an arbitrator or a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of these Terms invalid or unenforceable, that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and the other provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect.</p><p><b>Third party beneficiary</b></p><p>These Terms do not and are not intended to confer any rights or remedies upon any person other than the parties. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties agree that the payment card networks are third party beneficiaries of these Terms for purposes of enforcing provisions related to payments, but that their consent or agreement is not necessary for any changes or modifications to these Terms.</p><p><b>Additional Clauses for Users Contracting with SITE_NAME Ireland</b></p><p>The following paragraphs will apply if you are contracting with SITE_NAME Ireland.</p><p>The final sentence in the&nbsp;<b>Suspension, Termination and SITE_NAME Account Cancellation</b>&nbsp;clause shall be removed and replaced with the following:&nbsp;<i>"Please note that if your SITE_NAME Account is cancelled, we do not have an obligation to return to you any Content you have posted to the Site, Application and Services, including, but not limited to, any reviews or Feedback."</i></p><p>The&nbsp;<b>Controlling Law and Jurisdiction</b>&nbsp;clause shall be removed and replaced with the following:&nbsp;<i>"<b>Controlling Law and Jurisdiction</b>&nbsp;These Terms will be interpreted in accordance with Irish law.

If you access the Platform through a mobile device and you do not want your device to provide us with location-tracking information, you can disable the GPS or other location-tracking functions on your device, provided your device allows you to do this. See your device manufacturer\'s instructions for further details.</p><p><b>3.

We may also, either directly or through third party companies and individuals we engage to provide services to us, track your behavior on our own Platform to market and advertise our services to you on the Platform and third party websites. Third parties that use cookies and other tracking technologies to deliver targeted advertisements on our Platform and/or third party websites may offer you a way to prevent such targeted advertisements by opting-out at the websites of industry groups such as the Network Advertising Initiative (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/">http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/</a>) and/or the Digital Advertising Alliance (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/">http://www.aboutads.info/choices/</a>).

If you are not logged into your account with the third-party company, then the third party may not know your identity. If you are logged into your account with the third-party company, then the third party may be able to link information about your visit to our Platform to your account with them. Similarly, your interactions with the social plugin may be recorded by the third party.</p><p>Please refer to the third party\'s privacy policy to find out more about its data practices, such as what data is collected about you and how the third party uses such data.</p><p><b><u>HOW SITE_NAME USES AND PROCESSES THE INFORMATION THAT YOU PROVIDE OR MAKE AVAILABLE</u></b></p><p>We use, store and process Information about you for the following general purposes:&nbsp;</p><p></p><ol><br><li>to enable you to access and use the Platform;</li><br><li>to operate, protect, improve and optimize the Platform, SITE_NAME\'s business, and our users\' experience, such as to perform analytics, conduct research, personalize or otherwise customize your experience, and for advertising and marketing;</li><br><li>to help create and maintain a trusted and safer environment on the Platform and Services, such as fraud detection and prevention, conducting investigations and risk assessments, verifying the address of your listings, verifying any identifications provided by you, and conducting checks against databases such as public government databases;</li><br><li>to send you service, support and administrative messages, reminders, technical notices, updates, security alerts, and information requested by you;</li><br><li>where we have your consent, to send you marketing and promotional messages and other information that may be of interest to you, including information about SITE_NAME or general promotions for partner campaigns and services. You can unsubscribe or opt-out from receiving these communications in your settings (in the "Account" section) when you login to your SITE_NAME account;</li><br><li>to administer referral programs, rewards, surveys, sweepstakes, contests, or other promotional activities or events sponsored or managed by SITE_NAME or our business partners; and</li><br><li>to comply with our legal obligations, resolve any disputes that we may have with any of our users, and enforce our agreements with third parties.</li><br></ol><p></p><p><b><u>HOW SITE_NAME USES AND PROCESSES USER COMMUNICATIONS</u></b></p><p>We may, either directly or through third party companies and individuals we engage to provide services to us, review, scan, or analyze your communications with other users exchanged via the Platform for fraud prevention, risk assessment, regulatory compliance, investigation, product development, research and customer support purposes. For example, as part of our fraud prevention efforts, the Platform may scan and analyze messages to mask contact information and references to other websites. This helps to prevent fraudulent actors from asking Guests to send them money outside of the Platform, such as by bank transfer or other money transfer methods. We may also scan, review or analyze messages for research and product development purposes to help make search, booking and user communications more efficient and effective, as well as to debug, improve and expand product offerings.&nbsp;We will not review, scan, or analyze your communications for sending third party marketing messages to you. We will also not sell these reviews or analyses of communications to third parties. We will also use automated methods to carry out these reviews or analyses where reasonably possible. However, from time to time we may have to manually review some communications. By using the Platform, you consent that SITE_NAME, in its sole discretion, may, either directly or through third party companies and individuals we engage to provide services to us, review, scan, analyze, and store your communications, whether done manually or through automated means.</p><p><b><u>WHEN SITE_NAME DISCLOSES OR SHARES PERSONAL INFORMATION, AND TO WHOM</u></b></p><p><b>IMPORTANT: When you use the Platform, your data may be sent to the United States and possibly other countries</b></p><p>We may transfer, store, use and process your information, including any Personal Information, to countries outside of the European Economic Area ("<b>EEA</b>") including the United States.

The Platform may also display the Accommodation\'s approximate geographic location on a map, such that a user can see the general area of the Accommodation.</li><br><li>The Platform allows your public profile and public Listing pages to be included in search engines, in which case your public profile and public Listing pages will be indexed by search engines and may be published as search results. This option is enabled by default, and you may opt out of this feature by changing your settings on the Platform. If you change your settings or the information on your public profile or public Listing pages, third-party search engines may not update their databases quickly or at all.

The Platform also allows you to ask your friends and contacts to write a reference for you, to be published on your SITE_NAME profile.</p><p>We may integrate the Platform with third party sites such as Facebook, so that you can send invitation messages or requests for references via the third party site itself. These messages will be sent by the third party site, and SITE_NAME does not collect or retain the contact information that is used to send them.</p><p>You may also send invitation/request emails via the Platform itself, in which case we will ask you for the contact information to which to send your invitation/request. You can type in the email addresses or other contact information manually, or you can choose to import the contacts in your address book(s). In both cases, we may use and store this information for the sole purposes of allowing you to send your friends and contacts an invitation or request for a reference, and for fraud detection and prevention.

A cookie is a small data file that is transferred to your device (e.g., your phone or your computer) for record-keeping purposes. For example, a cookie could allow the Platform to recognize your browser, while another could store your preferences and other information.</p><p>Your browser may allow you to set how it handles cookies, such as declining all cookies or prompting you to decide whether to accept each cookie. But please note that some parts of the Platform may not work as intended or may not work at all without cookies.</p><p><b>SITE_NAME cookies and third party cookies</b></p><p>SITE_NAME may place our cookies on your device via the Platform. Accordingly, our Privacy Policy will apply to our treatment of the information we obtain via our cookies.</p><p>We may also allow our business partners to place cookies on your device. For example, we use Google Analytics for web analytics, and so Google may also set cookies on your device. As further explained below, third parties may also place cookies on your device for advertising purposes.</p><p>There are two types of cookies used on the Platform, namely "<b>persistent cookies</b>" and "<b>session cookies</b>".</p><p>Session cookies will normally expire when you close your browser, while persistent cookies will remain on your device after you close your browser, and can be used again the next time you access the Platform.</p><p><b>Other technologies</b></p><p>The Platform may also use other technologies with similar functionality to cookies, such as web beacons and tracking URLs to obtain Log Data about users. We may also use web beacons and tracking URLs in our messages to you to determine whether you have opened a certain message or accessed a certain link.</p><p><b>Uses for SITE_NAME cookies</b></p><p>SITE_NAME uses cookies for a number of purposes, such as the following:&nbsp;</p><p></p><ol><br><li>to enable, facilitate and streamline the functioning of the Platform across different webpages and browser sessions.</li><br><li>to simplify your access to and use of the Platform and make it more seamless.</li><br><li>to monitor and analyze the performance, operation and effectiveness of the Platform, so that we can improve and optimize it.</li><br><li>to show you content (which may include advertisements) that is more relevant to you.</li><br></ol><p></p><p><b>Uses for third party cookies</b></p><p>Our partners\' cookies are intended to obtain information to help them provide services to SITE_NAME. For example, third party companies and individuals we engage to provide services to us may track your behavior on our Platform to market and advertise SITE_NAME listings or services to you on the Platform and third party websites. Third parties that use cookies and other tracking technologies to deliver targeted advertisements on our Platform and/or third party websites may offer you a way to prevent such targeted advertisements by opting-out at the websites of industry groups such as the Network Advertising Initiative (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/">http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/</a>) and/or the Digital Advertising Alliance (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/">http://www.aboutads.info/choices/</a>). You may also be able to control advertising cookies provided by publishers, for example Google\'s Ad Preference Manager (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.google.com/settings/ads/onweb/">https://www.google.com/settings/ads/onweb/</a>). Please note that even if you choose to opt-out of receiving targeted advertising, you may still receive advertising on the Platform – it just will not be tailored to your interests.</p><p>In addition, Facebook places a cookie via the Platform that allows Facebook to obtain aggregated, non-Personal Information to optimize their services. For example, if a user clicks on an advertisement for the SITE_NAME mobile app on Facebook and subsequently installs the app, this cookie will inform Facebook that a user (who is not personally identified) has installed the app after clicking on the advertisement. This cookie may also inform Facebook that a user is using the app, without identifying the specific actions taken by the user in the app.</p><p><b>Disabling Cookies</b></p><p>Most browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can modify your browser setting to decline cookies by visiting the Help portion of your browser\'s toolbar. If you choose to decline cookies, please note that you may not be able to sign in, customize, or use some of the interactive features of the Platform.

Furthermore, these SITE_NAME Host Guarantee Terms are not an insurance service agreement as defined in a standard ISO renter’s or homeowner’s insurance policy.</li><p></p><p></p><li>The benefits provided under these SITE_NAME Host Guarantee Terms are solely as set forth in the paragraph entitled “SITE_NAME Host Guarantee” above and such benefits are not assignable or transferable by you, including without limitation any transfer or assignment by operation of law or in connection with your divorce or death.</li><p></p><p></p><li>SITE_NAME and/or its insurer reserve the right to independently investigate (or to have independently investigated) at our sole discretion and expense, the facts and circumstances of a payment request set forth in any SITE_NAME Host Guarantee Payment Request Form that you file with SITE_NAME, notwithstanding your delivery of all information and materials that you are required to provide SITE_NAME in order to comply with the conditions set forth in the paragraph entitled “Conditions to the SITE_NAME Host Guarantee.”&nbsp; </li><br></ul><p></p><p>You acknowledge and agree that if you make a claim under this Host Guarantee, you give SITE_NAME consent to review all communications between you and the allegedly Responsible Guest via the Site or Application.</p><p>SITE_NAME reserves the right, at any time, to offset or deduct from the amounts payable or paid by SITE_NAME to you under these SITE_NAME Host Guarantee Terms, any amounts that it may have in its possession, or to subsequently collect, from any other person or entity who is obligated to compensate you for losses or damages.</p><p>Because these SITE_NAME Host Guarantee Terms constitute a guarantee agreement, the theory of exoneration applies. Thus, if the Covered Property in question or the risk associated with that Covered Property changes materially, SITE_NAME will be entitled to exoneration with respect to any potential guaranty obligation under these SITE_NAME Host Guarantee Terms.</p><p><b>VII. Modification or Termination of SITE_NAME Host Guarantee Terms</b></p><p>To the extent permissible by applicable law in your jurisdiction, SITE_NAME reserves the right to modify or terminate these SITE_NAME Host Guarantee Terms, at any time, in its sole discretion, and without prior notice. If SITE_NAME terminates these SITE_NAME Host Guarantee Terms in accordance with the foregoing, SITE_NAME will provide you with notice of such termination and SITE_NAME will continue to process all SITE_NAME Host Guarantee Payment Request Forms that you filed prior to the effective date of termination, but your right to file any new SITE_NAME Host Guarantee Payment Request Forms will immediately terminate. If SITE_NAME modifies these SITE_NAME Host Guarantee Terms, we will post the modification on the Site or via the Application or provide you with notice of the modification and SITE_NAME will continue to process all SITE_NAME Host Guarantee Payment Request Forms that you filed prior to the effective date of the modification. By continuing to access or use the Site, Application or Services as a Host after we have posted a modification on the Site or via the Application or have provided you with notice of a modification, you are indicating that you agree to be bound by the modified SITE_NAME Host Guarantee Terms. If the modified SITE_NAME Host Guarantee Terms are not acceptable to you, your only recourse is to cease using the Site, Application and Services as a Host.</p><p>In addition to and without limiting SITE_NAME’s rights set forth above in the immediately preceding paragraph, SITE_NAME reserves the right to modify or terminate these SITE_NAME Host Guarantee Terms generally or in any jurisdiction, at any time, in its sole discretion, if: (i) these SITE_NAME Host Guarantee Terms are construed to be an offer to insure or constitute insurance or an insurance contract or insurance service agreement by any governmental or regulatory authority in any jurisdiction; (ii) SITE_NAME is required to obtain a license or permit of any kind to continue to provide these SITE_NAME Host Guarantee Terms in any jurisdiction; or (iii) SITE_NAME determines or a court or arbitrator holds that the provisions of these SITE_NAME Host Guarantee Terms violate applicable law. If SITE_NAME modifies or terminates these SITE_NAME Host Guarantee Terms in accordance with the foregoing, SITE_NAME will process all SITE_NAME Host Guarantee Payment Request Forms that you file prior to or as of the effective date of such modification or termination unless such processing is prohibited by law, regulation, ordinance, order, or decree of any governmental or other authority.</p><p>SITE_NAME’s obligations hereunder are contingent upon the availability of insurance proceeds under the SITE_NAME Insurance Policy. The applicable terms and conditions of such policy will be the terms and conditions in effect on the date of the Covered Loss, and not the terms and conditions in effect on the date that the Responsible Guest booked or reserved the applicable Covered Accommodation or the date on which the Host listed the Covered Accommodation. If the policy terms and conditions change in any material respect between the date of the Listing and the first date of the Guest’s stay, SITE_NAME will use its best efforts to notify you of the change(s) pursuant to the procedures set forth above in this section.</p><p><b>VIII.

THE LIMITATIONS OF DAMAGES SET FORTH ABOVE ARE FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENTS OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN SITE_NAME AND YOU.

General Provisions</b></p><p><i>Indemnification</i></p><p>You agree to release, defend, indemnify, and hold SITE_NAME and its affiliates and subsidiaries, and their officers, directors, employees and agents, harmless from and against any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable legal and accounting fees, arising out of or in any way connected with the SITE_NAME Host Guarantee and these SITE_NAME Host Guarantee Terms.</p><p>If you rent (rather than own) the accommodation that you list as a Covered Accommodation, the immediately preceding paragraph applies specifically to any dispute between you and the owner of the accommodation. You are fully responsible for securing the lessor’s permission to list the accommodation with SITE_NAME and complying with the scope of any permission granted.</p><p><i>Entire Agreement</i></p><p>These SITE_NAME Host Guarantee Terms constitute the entire and exclusive understanding and agreement between SITE_NAME and you regarding the SITE_NAME Host Guarantee and these SITE_NAME Host Guarantee Terms, and supersede and replace any and all prior oral or written understandings or agreements between SITE_NAME and you regarding the SITE_NAME Host Guarantee.</p><p><i>Assignment</i></p><p>You may not assign or transfer these SITE_NAME Host Guarantee Terms, by operation of law or otherwise, without SITE_NAME’s prior written consent. Any attempt by you to assign or transfer these SITE_NAME Host Guarantee Terms, without such consent, will be null and of no effect. SITE_NAME may assign or transfer these SITE_NAME Host Guarantee Terms, at its sole discretion, without restriction. Subject to the foregoing, these SITE_NAME Host Guarantee Terms will bind and inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors and permitted assigns.</p><p><i>Notices</i></p><p>Any notices or other communications permitted or required hereunder, including those regarding modifications to these SITE_NAME Host Guarantee Terms, will be in writing and given by SITE_NAME (i) via e-mail (in each case to the address that you provide) or (ii) by posting to the Site or via the Application. For notices made by e-mail, the date of receipt will be deemed the date on which such notice is transmitted.</p><p><i>Controlling Law</i></p><p>These SITE_NAME Host Guarantee Terms will be interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of California and the United States of America, without regard to its conflict-of-law provisions.</p><p><i>Dispute Resolution</i></p><p><u>General</u>. You and SITE_NAME agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to these SITE_NAME Host Guarantee Terms or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof, or to the use of the Services or use of the Site or Application (collectively, “<b>Disputes</b>”) will be settled by binding arbitration. You acknowledge and agree that you and SITE_NAME are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class action or representative proceeding. Further, unless both you and SITE_NAME otherwise agree in writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class or representative proceeding. If this specific paragraph is held unenforceable, then the entirety of this “Dispute Resolution” section will be deemed void. Except as provided in the preceding sentence, this “Dispute Resolution” section will survive any termination of these SITE_NAME Host Guarantee Terms.</p><p><u>Arbitration Rules and Governing Law</u>. The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (“<b>AAA</b>”) in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (the “<b>AAA Rules</b>”) then in effect, except as modified by this “Dispute Resolution” section. (The AAA Rules are available at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.adr.org/arb_med">http://www.adr.org/arb_med</a> or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.) The Federal Arbitration Act will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Section.</p><p><u>Arbitration Process</u>. A party who desires to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a written Demand for Arbitration as specified in the AAA Rules. (The AAA provides a form Demand for Arbitration at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.adr.org/si.asp?id=3477">http://www.adr.org/si.asp?id=3477</a> and a separate form for California residents at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.adr.org/si.asp?id=3485">http://www.adr.org/si.asp?id=3485</a>.) The arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law in the state of California and will be selected by the parties from the AAA’s roster of consumer dispute arbitrators. If the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within seven (7) days of delivery of the Demand for Arbitration, then the AAA will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with the AAA Rules.</p><p><u>Arbitration Location and Procedure</u>. Unless you and SITE_NAME otherwise agree, the arbitration will be conducted in the county where you reside. If your claim does not exceed $10,000, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents you and SITE_NAME submit to the arbitrator, unless you request a hearing or the arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary. If your claim exceeds $10,000, your right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Subject to the AAA Rules, the arbitrator will have the discretion to direct a reasonable exchange of information by the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration.</p><p><u>Arbitrator’s Decision</u>. The arbitrator will render an award within the time frame specified in the AAA Rules. The arbitrator’s decision will include the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator based the award. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The arbitrator’s award damages must be consistent with the terms of the “Disclaimers and Limitations of Liability” section above as to the types and the amounts of damages for which a party may be held liable. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the claimant and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the claimant’s individual claim. If you prevail in arbitration you will be entitled to an award of attorneys’ fees and expenses, to the extent provided under applicable law. SITE_NAME will not seek, and hereby waives all rights it may have under applicable law to recover, attorneys’ fees and expenses if it prevails in arbitration.</p><p><u>Arbitration Fees</u>. Your responsibility to pay any AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees will be solely as set forth in the AAA Rules. However, if your claim for damages does not exceed $75,000, SITE_NAME will pay all such fees unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in your Demand for Arbitration was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)).</p><p><u>Changes</u>. Notwithstanding the provisions of the “Modification or Termination of SITE_NAME Host Guarantee Terms” section above, if SITE_NAME changes this “Dispute Resolution” section after the date you first accepted these SITE_NAME Host Guarantee Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these SITE_NAME Host Guarantee Terms), you may reject any such change by sending us written notice (including by email to <a target="_blank" href="mailto:terms@SITE_URL">terms@SITE_URL</a>) within 30 days of the date such change became effective, as indicated in the “Last Updated Date” above or in the date of SITE_NAME’s email to you notifying you of such change. By rejecting any change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any Dispute between you and SITE_NAME in accordance with the provisions of this “Dispute Resolution” section as of the date you first accepted these SITE_NAME Host Guarantee Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these SITE_NAME Host Guarantee Terms).</p><p><i>Waiver and Severability</i></p><p>The failure of SITE_NAME to enforce any right or provision of these SITE_NAME Host Guarantee Terms will not constitute a waiver of future enforcement of that right or provision. The waiver of any such right or provision will be effective only if in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of SITE_NAME. Except as expressly set forth in these SITE_NAME Host Guarantee Terms, the exercise by either party of any of its remedies under these SITE_NAME Host Guarantee Terms will be without prejudice to its other remedies under these SITE_NAME Host Guarantee Terms or otherwise. If for any reason an arbitrator or a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of these SITE_NAME Host Guarantee Terms invalid or unenforceable, that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and the other provisions of these SITE_NAME Host Guarantee Terms will remain in full force and effect.</p><p><b>XI.

During the 24-hour period following the Guest’s check-in, Hosts should be available, or make a third-party available, in order to try, in good faith, to resolve Guest issues.<br>If you are a Host, and if (i) SITE_NAME determines that a Guest has suffered a Travel Issue related to an Accommodation listed by you and (ii) SITE_NAME either reimburses that Guest any amount up to the amount paid by the Guest through the Site for the Accommodation or provides an alternative Accommodation to the Guest, you agree to reimburse SITE_NAME up to the amount paid by SITE_NAME within 30 days of SITE_NAME’s request.&nbsp; All determinations of SITE_NAME with respect to the Guest Refund Policy, including without limitation the size of any refund to the Guest, shall be final and binding on the Guests and Hosts.&nbsp; You also agree that in order for you to reimburse SITE_NAME up to the amount paid by SITE_NAME, SITE_NAME may off-set or reduce any amounts owed by SITE_NAME to you by this amount. If the Guest remains for part or all of the stay despite the Travel Issue, the Guest will receive a refund that will reduce the amount of the Accommodation Fees ultimately paid to you. If the Guest is relocated to an alternative Accommodation, you may lose part or all of the Accommodation Fee payment for the booking and you may be responsible for reasonable additional costs incurred to relocate the Guest to the alternative Accommodation.<br>The rights of the Guests under the Guest Refund Policy supersede the cancellation policy established by a Host.&nbsp; If you dispute the Travel Issue you may notify us in writing or via telephone and provide us with information (including photographs or other evidence) disputing the claims regarding the Travel Issue, provided you must have used reasonable and good faith efforts to try to remedy the Travel Issue with the Guest prior to disputing the Travel Issue claim. You agree that all determinations of SITE_NAME with respect to the Travel Issue shall be final and binding on the Guests and Hosts regardless of your submission of a dispute against such Travel Issue.&nbsp; In the event of one or more Travel Issues, SITE_NAME, in its discretion, may elect to take additional actions.
